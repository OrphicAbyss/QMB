=========================================================================
A patch to add AVI capture to modified Quake1 engines on Win32 platforms.
=========================================================================

You capture both audio and video from any resolution supported by Quake1,
at any framerate (you don't have to be able to process in realtime),
using any AVI codec. There is explicit support for capturing existing DEMs.
You can capture gameplay if you like, but the audio may well sound bad
as you play - the main aim of the code was to allow conversion of demos.

An earlier version of this code has been tested on a variety of Win32
platforms, but the version you have here has not been widely tested at
the time of writing. Please let me know if you have problems.

You will need vfw32.h to compile, and avifil32.dll et al to run.
I assume these are available as standard on development and user Win32
platforms respectively.


If you just want to use capture directly rather than add it to your own
codebase, you can just grab a recent build of the trr_engine from which the
code has been extracted from, e.g.
<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/the-rabbit-run/trr27exe.zip>


__To patch your Quake1 codebase__

Add the four files to your WinQuake project, and follow the instructions
and example code snips in CaptureHelpers.h to wire them into your codebase.


__Setting up console variables__

 Use 'host_framerate' to set a frametime in seconds. Remember that
 id misnamed the variable - use 'host_framerate 0.1' to set a frame
 time of 0.1s and hence a framerate of 10fps.

 Variable '_snd_mixahead' should be set to something greater than
 host_framerate to allow the engine to generate the audio.

 Use 'capture_codec' to specify an AVI fourcc codec.
  E.g. 'capture_codec divx'.
  The default value of "0" indicates no compression.

 I recommend using a framerate that evenly divides the audio rate.
  15fps, set with 'host_framerate 0.0666666666667', always works well for me.


__Using console commands__

 'capture_start <filename>': begins capturing to the named file.

 'capture_stop': ends capture and writes the file.

 'capturedemo <demoname>': works like 'playdemo', but captures an
  appropriately named AVI from the demo, and exits on completion.
  Uses 15fps if user has not set their own fps via 'host_framerate'.
  Designed for batch use from the command-line, along the lines of
    glquake.exe -window -width W -height H +capture_codec CCCC
	 +host_framerate HFR +capturedemo DEMONAME
